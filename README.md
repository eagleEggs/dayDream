# dayDream

Load a script into game view and edit it live on a code overlay with your effects rendering in realtime in the background.


#### Setup
You can either load the Asset Package from this repository, or attach the scripts manually (Documentation in progess).


#### Warning
Make backups!!! This tool literally overwrites the file you specify to overlay in game view. You may accidentally lose data.
