# dayDream

Load a script into game view and edit it live on a code overlay with your effects rendering in realtime in the background.


#### Setup
You can either load the Asset Package from this repository, or attach the scripts manually (Documentation in progess).


#### Warning
Make backups!!! This tool literally overwrites the file you specify to overlay in game view. You may accidentally lose data.


#### Controls

While in Game View (Play Mode):

```
CTRL+Z = Load Shader script into dayDream (Do this initially to see code)
CTRL+X = Save changes (Will update it live)
CTRL+R = Reload Shader to it's original code (losing all changes) - Useful for fixing broken shader
CTRL+C = Randomly change color of text
CTRL+V = Randomly change color of code background
CTRL+B = Toggle background behind the code
CTRL+D = Toggle dayDream overlay on/off

```
